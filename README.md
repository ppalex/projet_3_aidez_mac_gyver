# Project 3: Help MacGyver to get out of the maze!

## Description

I made this game in the scope of my OpenClassRooms developper course.

The game is developed in python and the pygame module is used to add a visual layer on the game.

To achieve the goal of the project, I created a 2D maze in which you can move a character to go out of this
maze.


## Rules of the game

MacGyver is locked up in the maze. 

The only gate to escape this trap is guarded by a bodyguard.

In order to win the game, you have to gather three items spread over the maze and craft a syringe.

Take the needle, the tube and the ether to make your weapon and send the bodyguard off to sleep, then you will be free.
